# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-1:** Search Functionality
  - **Description:** As the name implies, this requirement involves providing the user the ability to search for products for narrow or broad results depending on input.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** While not essential, it does provide quality of life and speeds up the process for a user.
  - **Testing:** Providing the search with multiple strings of text and seeing if the result returns the appropriate products.
- **REQ-2:** Payment Integration
  - **Description:** Provide various common options for payment (PayPal, Debit/Credit Card, etc).
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** While having a single option of payment (card) would be sufficient, allowing the user to use a more preferred method would provide quality of life. 
  - **Testing:** Go through an order with each option as if one were a regular customer.
- **REQ-3:** Product Reviews
  - **Description:** Provide users the option to create and view reviews/ratings for individual products.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** An important feature for an online store of any type is to view and create reviews of products in order to make informed purchases.
  - **Testing:** Creating reviews and viewing existing reviews for products.

  [Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-1:** Sorting Functionality
  - **Description:** Give the user the ability to sort lists of products by name, price, kind etc.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** It will serve as a good feature to enhance user experience.
  - **Testing:** A function that will accept a list of strings, and will return the same list in a sorted manner.
- **REQ-2:** Apply coupons
  - **Description:** We will provide the user with the option of inputing a discount coupon.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** This feature will indulge the user to purchase more products and keep using our app in the future.
  - **Testing:** A function which will receive a list of products and their prices as a collection(to imitate a checkout cart) and a coupon code (which worth will be predefined ahead), and will output a calculation of the new discounted price.
- **REQ-3:** Similar Products
  - **Description:** Right before the user checks out, the app will present them offers to purchase similar products. For example, if they purchased tomatoes, the offers will be peppers, onions, etc.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** This is a good way to increase revenue, since the user might be offered to purchase something that he initially didn't plan, but will add to the cart right before the final purchase ("might as well").
  - **Testing:** Deviding all of our producrs into category groups. Once the user's cart is full, we redirect the user to a new page, pull 5 products from our database which are in the same category for each product in the cart (can be done randomly), and present them in the new page in a nice display. So for testing purposes we will create a function which takes a list of products as an input and returns a new list with 5 products of each category that exist in the input list. 

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **CON-1:** Time Constraints
  - **Description:** As each member has different and unique tasks and responsibilities, including those outside of this course, there is the potential for a member to be unable to complete a task due to unexpected circumstances.
- **CON-2:** Technical Limitations
  - **Description:** There is the potential when working exclusively with Python and Flask that issues may arrise when trying to create or optimize certain features and functions.

[Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
- **CON-1:** Role authentication Functionality
  - **Description:** Create a user hierarchy and limit different sections of the app to the user role. For example, an admin will be able to access different pages which other roles can't, a logged in user will be able to access pages which a guest can't, etc. This is extremely important since the app will contain sensitive data such as payment methods, accout numbers, etc.
- **CON-2:** Section Constraints
  - **Description:** Each member will work on different sections of the project. For example, one can work on styling the website, the other on implementing the login/logout and privacy settings, the third on creating the database and so on. Those tasks can be shuffled and adjusted based on progress and time frames.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **UC-1:** General Grocery Shopping
  - **Description:** A user will be able to use website for searching for, reviewing, and comparing products as well as making a purchase for delivery.
  - **Actors:** Customer, owner(s)/administrator(s).
  - **Preconditions:** The customer must have the funds necessary and and the product must be available with the sufficient quantity required.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer has the product(s) shipped to them from the website's storage and the website receives the money from the transaction.
- **UC-2:** Bulk purchasing
  - **Description:** Businesses or individuals will be able to bulk purchase (potentially hundreds) products at typically a discounted price.
  - **Actors:** Customer(s), owner(s)/administrator(s).
  - **Preconditions:** The customer(s) must have the funds necessary and the product must be available with the sufficient quantity required.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer has the product(s) shipped to them from the website's storage and the website receives the money from the transaction.

[Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
- **UC-1:** Out of stock item
  - **Description:** The customer is attempting to purchase a product that is out of stock.
  - **Actors:** Customer, owner(s)/administrator(s).
  - **Preconditions:** The product has to be in stock in order to be added to the cart.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer will be able to add the product to the cart if it is in stock (we will track each product's count), and won't be able to add it otherwise.
- **UC-2:** Lost username/password
  - **Description:** The user will be able to retrieve his lost username/password.
  - **Actors:** Customer(s), owner(s)/administrator(s).
  - **Preconditions:** The customer has lost or forgot his login credentials
  - **Postconditions:** The customer requests to retrieve his lost credentials, the app will perform a database search to make sure the user is in the system, and will provide him with the option to create a new password.

## User Stories

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **US-1:** Searching for products and purchasing them.
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** The customer enters the website and is met by the homepage with an array of products on display. This customer, however, already has produts in mind and uses the provided search bar (also on the homepage) and types in specific strings of text pertaining the items desired. For each product the customer is able to view prices and read reviews from different brands and adds them to their cart. Once all the items have been added the customer is then able to check out as a guest and provided their shipping and billing information when choosing to pay with a debit card. Once the transaction is complete, an online receipt is provided and emailed along with shipping/tracking information.
- **US-2:** Bulk purchasing items.
  - **Type of User:** Company
  - **Description:** Similar to **US-1** a company would like to make a large purchase of raw ingredients for their business. The same process applies but when choosing the quantity of an item a discount is applied after a certain number due to it being a bulk purchase. The process for purchasing and entering information also remains the same.

[Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **US-1:** Login/logout.
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** The customer enters the website and is pressing the 'login' link in the header. The software will perform an authentication process to make sure that the user is in the system and based on that will allow him to login to their account. The account will include unique information such as past orders and will allow the user to repurchase that order or edit it. Once the user is in his account, a 'logout' option will be added to the header. 
- **US-2:** Cancel order.
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** The user placed an order but then changed his mind, or realized something in the details is not right. The user will be given a short window time frame (about 15 minutes), to cancel his order.
  

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **G-1:** `Bulk Purchase`
  - **Definition:** A purchase primarily done by businesses that require a lot of certain products, such as raw ingredients. Typically purchased in the hundreds of items, these transactions are discounted and individually cheaper than a usual customer purchase.

[Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
- **G-1:** `Lost my username/password`
  - **Definition:** A Customer is trying to login to their account, but forgot one or more of their credentials. The login card will display a 'forgot username/password' option link which will help the user to retrieve the details.
