# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-1:** Search Functionality
  - **Description:** As the name implies, this requirement involves providing the user the ability to search for products for narrow or broad results depending on input.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** While not essential, it does provide quality of life and speeds up the process for a user.
  - **Testing:** Providing the search with multiple strings of text and seeing if the result returns the appropriate products.
- **REQ-2:** Payment Integration
  - **Description:** Provide various common options for payment (PayPal, Debit/Credit Card, etc).
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** While having a single option of payment (card) would be sufficient, allowing the user to use a more preferred method would provide quality of life. 
  - **Testing:** Go through an order with each option as if one were a regular customer.
- **REQ-3:** Product Reviews
  - **Description:** Provide users the option to create and view reviews/ratings for individual products.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** An important feature for an online store of any type is to view and create reviews of products in order to make informed purchases.
  - **Testing:** Creating reviews and viewing existing reviews for products.

[Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-4:** Sorting Functionality
  - **Description:** Give the user the ability to sort lists of products by name, price, kind etc.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** It will serve as a good feature to enhance user experience.
  - **Testing:** A function that will accept a list of strings, and will return the same list in a sorted manner.
- **REQ-5:** Apply coupons
  - **Description:** We will provide the user with the option of inputing a discount coupon.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** This feature will indulge the user to purchase more products and keep using our app in the future.
  - **Testing:** A function which will receive a list of products and their prices as a collection(to imitate a checkout cart) and a coupon code (which worth will be predefined ahead), and will output a calculation of the new discounted price.
- **REQ-6:** Similar Products
  - **Description:** Right before the user checks out, the app will present them offers to purchase similar products. For example, if they purchased tomatoes, the offers will be peppers, onions, etc.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** This is a good way to increase revenue, since the user might be offered to purchase something that he initially didn't plan, but will add to the cart right before the final purchase ("might as well").
  - **Testing:** Deviding all of our producrs into category groups. Once the user's cart is full, we redirect the user to a new page, pull 5 products from our database which are in the same category for each product in the cart (can be done randomly), and present them in the new page in a nice display. So for testing purposes we will create a function which takes a list of products as an input and returns a new list with 5 products of each category that exist in the input list. 

[Eric Hedgepeth](mailto:ehedgepe@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-7:** Order Confirmation Email
  - **Description:**  Send a confirmation email to customers after successfully placing an order, including order details, shipping information, and a summary of purchased items.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:**  Sending an order confirmation email helps provide customers with a record of their purchase, enhances trust and transparency, and serves as a reference for future inquiries or returns.
  - **Testing:**Configure the system to send automated order confirmation emails to customers upon order placement. Verify that the email contains accurate order details and reaches the customer's email inbox successfully.
- **REQ-8:** Account Registration and Guest Checkout
  - **Description:**  Provide customers with the option to create an account for easier future purchases or to proceed with a guest checkout for quicker one-time purchases.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** Offering both account registration and guest checkout options caters to different user preferences, allowing for a seamless and personalized shopping experience while accommodating occasional or new customers. 
  - **Testing:**  Implement account registration functionality that allows users to create and manage their accounts. Additionally, enable a guest checkout option where customers can proceed with the purchase without creating an account.
- **REQ-9:** Quantity Adjustment in the Shopping Cart
  - **Description:** Allow customers to adjust the quantity of items in their shopping cart before proceeding to checkout.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** This feature provides flexibility to customers, allowing them to modify the quantity of items they want to purchase without having to remove and re-add items to the cart.
  - **Testing:** Implement quantity adjustment controls (+/-) in the shopping cart and validate that the changes are reflected accurately in the cart total and item quantities.
  
[Majd Alawar](mailto:malawar@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-10:** Real-Time Inventory Management
  - **Description:**  The system should provide real-time inventory management to accurately track product availability and prevent overselling. It should update inventory levels immediately after a purchase is made or when new stock is added.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:**  Real-time inventory management ensures that customers can only purchase products that are actually in stock, reducing the likelihood of order cancellations or delays due to inventory discrepancies.
  - **Testing:** Test the system's inventory management by simulating multiple concurrent transactions and verifying that the inventory levels are accurately updated in real-time. Perform tests for both purchase scenarios and stock replenishment scenarios.
- **REQ-11:** Order Tracking and Shipment Notifications
  - **Description:** The system should provide order tracking functionality, allowing customers to monitor the status of their orders from purchase to delivery. It should also send shipment notifications to customers, providing updates on the progress of their shipments.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** Order tracking and shipment notifications enhance the customer experience by keeping them informed about the status of their orders. It increases transparency and helps manage customer expectations regarding delivery times.
  - **Testing:** Place test orders with different statuses (e.g., processing, shipped, delivered) and verify that customers can track their orders using unique order tracking numbers. Additionally, ensure that shipment notifications are sent at relevant stages and that customers receive accurate and timely updates.
- **REQ-12:** Product Recommendations
  - **Description:** The system should provide personalized product recommendations to customers based on their browsing and purchase history. These recommendations can be displayed on the homepage, product pages, or in a dedicated recommendations section.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** Product recommendations help increase customer engagement, promote cross-selling and upselling, and improve the overall shopping experience. By suggesting relevant products, customers are more likely to discover and purchase items of interest.
  - **Testing:** Test the system's recommendation algorithm by simulating user interactions and purchase histories. Verify that the system accurately generates personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior.
  
## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **CON-1:** Time Constraints
  - **Description:** As each member has different and unique tasks and responsibilities, including those outside of this course, there is the potential for a member to be unable to complete a task due to unexpected circumstances.
- **CON-2:** Technical Limitations
  - **Description:** There is the potential when working exclusively with Python and Flask that issues may arrise when trying to create or optimize certain features and functions.

[Dimitry Papish](mailto:dpapish@uncc.edu)
- **CON-3:** Role authentication Functionality
  - **Description:** Create a user hierarchy and limit different sections of the app to the user role. For example, an admin will be able to access different pages which other roles can't, a logged in user will be able to access pages which a guest can't, etc. This is extremely important since the app will contain sensitive data such as payment methods, accout numbers, etc.
- **CON-4:** Section Constraints
  - **Description:** Each member will work on different sections of the project. For example, one can work on styling the website, the other on implementing the login/logout and privacy settings, the third on creating the database and so on. Those tasks can be shuffled and adjusted based on progress and time frames.
  
[Eric Hedgepeth](mailto:ehedgepe@uncc.edu)
- **CON-5:** Performance and Scalability
  - **Description:** The software system must be designed and optimized to handle increasing user loads and a growing database of products, ensuring performance and scalability to maintain a smooth user experience.
- **CON-6:** First Major Project with Collaboration
  - **Description:**  This project represents the first major collaborative project for some team members, with a focus on effective communication, coordination, and division of tasks among team members.
