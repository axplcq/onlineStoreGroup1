# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **REQ-1:** Search Functionality
  - **Description:** As the name implies, this requirement involves providing the user the ability to search for products for narrow or broad results depending on input.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** While not essential, it does provide quality of life and speeds up the process for a user.
  - **Testing:** Providing the search with multiple strings of text and seeing if the result returns the appropriate products.
- **REQ-2:** Payment Integration
  - **Description:** Provide various common options for payment (PayPal, Debit/Credit Card, etc).
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** While having a single option of payment (card) would be sufficient, allowing the user to use a more preferred method would provide quality of life. 
  - **Testing:** Go through an order with each option as if one were a regular customer.
- **REQ-3:** Product Reviews
  - **Description:** Provide users the option to create and view reviews/ratings for individual products.
  - **Type:** `Functional`
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** An important feature for an online store of any type is to view and create reviews of products in order to make informed purchases.
  - **Testing:** Creating reviews and viewing existing reviews for products.

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **CON-1:** Time Constraints
  - **Description:** As each member has different and unique tasks and responsibilities, including those outside of this course, there is the potential for a member to be unable to complete a task due to unexpected circumstances.
- **CON-2:** Technical Limitations
  - **Description:** There is the potential when working exclusively with Python and Flask that issues may arrise when trying to create or optimize certain features and functions.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **UC-1:** General Grocery Shopping
  - **Description:** A user will be able to use website for searching for, reviewing, and comparing products as well as making a purchase for delivery.
  - **Actors:** Customer, owner(s)/administrator(s).
  - **Preconditions:** The customer must have the funds necessary and and the product must be available with the sufficient quantity required.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer has the product(s) shipped to them from the website's storage and the website receives the money from the transaction.
- **UC-2:** Bulk purchasing
  - **Description:** Businesses or individuals will be able to bulk purchase (potentially hundreds) products at typically a discounted price.
  - **Actors:** Customer(s), owner(s)/administrator(s).
  - **Preconditions:** The customer(s) must have the funds necessary and the product must be available with the sufficient quantity required.
  - **Postconditions:** The customer has the product(s) shipped to them from the website's storage and the website receives the money from the transaction.

## User Stories

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **US-1:** Searching for products and purchasing them.
  - **Type of User:** Customer
  - **Description:** The customer enters the website and is met by the homepage with an array of products on display. This customer, however, already has produts in mind and uses the provided search bar (also on the homepage) and types in specific strings of text pertaining the items desired. For each product the customer is able to view prices and read reviews from different brands and adds them to their cart. Once all the items have been added the customer is then able to check out as a guest and provided their shipping and billing information when choosing to pay with a debit card. Once the transaction is complete, an online receipt is provided and emailed along with shipping/tracking information.
- **US-2:** Bulk purchasing items.
  - **Type of User:** Company
  - **Description:** Similar to **US-1** a company would like to make a large purchase of raw ingredients for their business. The same process applies but when choosing the quantity of an item a discount is applied after a certain number due to it being a bulk purchase. The process for purchasing and entering information also remains the same.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

[Alex Perez-Correa](mailto:aperezco@uncc.edu)
- **G-1:** `Bulk Purchase`
  - **Definition:** A purchase primarily done by businesses that require a lot of certain products, such as raw ingredients. Typically purchased in the hundreds of items, these transactions are discounted and individually cheaper than a usual customer purchase.

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
  - The URL to your group's GitHub repository, with the latest version of your code pushed to the `main` branch.
