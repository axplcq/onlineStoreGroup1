# Online Store Final submission

### Instructions for activation  

to make the app work properly, there are a few things need to be done:  
- run "pip install Flask-Mail" (for forgotten password functionality)
- in the database folder, run "create_login_table.py"

- The application has a seperate route for "customers" and "admin" who has the capability of adding/deleting/updating users and inventory. To examine this log in with: username: 'aturing', password: '123' (this user defined as 'admin' in the database).

* The orders section doesn't display the data in the table, couldn't fix it due to lack of time.
